// run into one cell range makes both renderers (WebGL atlas, DOM row factory)
// draw the run as a single string, letting the browser apply contextual
// shaping and BiDi ordering inside the run's grid-aligned cell box. The
// terminal buffer and PTY stream are untouched, and xterm itself un-joins any
// range that holds the cursor or a partially selected span, so cursor
// visibility and selection stay cell-accurate.
