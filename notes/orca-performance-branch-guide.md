# orca-performance Branch Guide

Agent-facing map of every optimization on this branch: what it does, why it exists,
where it lives, and the invariants you must not break when adding to it. The
chronological evidence trail (benchmarks, retractions, A/B protocols) is in
`notes/terminal-performance-initiative.md`; this doc is the *current-state* view.

**Context**: Orca's terminal was ~300× slower than Terminal.app under agent load
(DSR-under-load p50 134ms, p99 292ms on v1.4.91; agent-TUI throughput 2.0 MB/s).
As of v1.4.122-rc.1.perf: p50 13.3ms / p99 18.7ms, zero timeouts, throughput
11.8–15.5 MB/s — beats VS Code on 5 of 6 metrics. Goal line still open: 4.5ms
(10× Terminal.app).

## The pipeline

```
shell → pty → daemon (persistence, headless model) → unix socket
     → main (ipc/pty.ts: batching, delivery gate, flow control, snapshots)
     → IPC → renderer (pty-dispatcher → pty-connection → output scheduler → xterm)
```

Main is on the hot path for every byte (unlike VS Code's ptyHost→renderer
MessagePort). The daemon owns sessions so they survive app restarts; it also runs
a headless xterm emulator per pty — the *model* — which is the source of truth
for screen contents. The renderer terminal is a *view* that can be discarded and
rebuilt from model snapshots.

## Optimization inventory

### 1. Renderer parse-path fixes (the original 16× on agent TUIs)
- **Parse-clocked scheduler drains** (`pane-terminal-output-scheduler.ts`): drain
  cadence follows xterm's actual parse completion instead of fixed timers, so the
  queue never outruns the parser.
- **Windowed retained-tail redraw**: TUI repaints (erase-down + redraw) only
  re-process a bounded window instead of the full retained tail. Guarded by
  differential fuzz `retained-tail-redraw-window.equivalence.test.ts`.
- **Throttled wait-blocked check** (`orca-runtime.ts`): the per-chunk agent
  wait-detection (two 256KB waitText builds + multi-pattern scans) now runs at
  50ms cadence with trailing edge + keyword pre-filter. Was ~85% of main's
  per-chunk cost.

### 2. term-speed-2 chain (model/view contract — the architecture)
Revived from ~38 never-merged branches; kill-switched, default ON. Docs:
`docs/reference/terminal-model-view-contract.md`.
- **Hidden view parking**: hidden tabs tear down their xterm view entirely
  (memory: parked panes cost ~0).
- **Hidden delivery gate** (main): renderer-bound bytes for hidden ptys are
  dropped at main — hidden panes receive nothing. Reveal rebuilds the view from a
  model snapshot + live chunks after the snapshot's seq.
- **Side-effect authority**: main extracts side-effect facts (bell, title, cwd)
  from the model so parked panes stay live in the UI without a view.
- **Model query authority**: main answers terminal queries (DSR/CPR, DA1, OSC
  colors) deterministically from the model for hidden panes.
- **Seq/ordered-delivery bookkeeping**: every chunk carries a seq; reveal
  reconciliation drops duplicates already covered by the snapshot baseline.

### 3. Batching & scheduling cadence
- **Batch windows 8ms → 2ms** in both `daemon-stream-data-batcher.ts`
  (`STREAM_DATA_BATCH_INTERVAL_MS`) and `ipc/pty.ts` (`PTY_BATCH_INTERVAL_MS`).
  At 9% utilization there is no queue — latency was literally the sum of fixed
  batch windows. This one change took dev DSR-load 19→8ms.
- **MessageChannel zero-delay drains** (`pane-terminal-output-scheduler.ts`):
  Chromium clamps nested `setTimeout(0)` to ~4ms; posted messages are macrotasks
  without the clamp, preserving cooperative yield (input/paint still serviced).
  Vitest keeps the timer path (fake timers can't advance channel posts).
- **Input write coalescing** (from main, #7205): renderer input writes coalesce
  instead of queuing macrotask-per-keystroke.

### 4. Backpressure (the correctness spine — read before touching delivery)
Three cooperating layers, innermost first:
- **ACK at parse-drain** (`deliverPtyDataWithDeferredAck`, scheduler
  `ackCredit`): the renderer credits a chunk when xterm has *parsed* it (or the
  chunk is legitimately discarded), not when IPC delivered it.
  **INVARIANT: every delivered chunk credits exactly once — parsed or
  discarded.** Every scheduler/pty-connection discard path (backlog replacement,
  disposed terminal, reconcile drop, split remainders) must fire the credit.
- **Cumulative ACKs + solicited resync** (`terminal-pty-ack-gate.ts`,
  `applyCumulativeAck` in pty.ts): ACKs carry monotonic per-pty processed totals
  (TCP-style); main max-merges, so lost ACKs self-heal. Data arriving for a
  fully-gated pty triggers a resync probe instead of a timeout reset. The only
  timer is a hygiene warn that mutates nothing. Main's 512KB per-pty in-flight
  gate + 2MB pendingData cap sit on top.
- **Renderer-pull delivery watchdog** (`terminal-delivery-watchdog.ts`,
  `pty:reportRendererDeliveryState` in pty.ts): recovers the field-confirmed
  wedge where every main→renderer PUSH channel dies while invoke stays alive
  (v1.4.121-rc.0 snapshot; electron#37067 class) — a state the push-ridden
  resync probe can never reach. The 15s heartbeat costs one Map upsert per
  received chunk and does no IPC while output flows; mutation stays
  verified-state-only (the timer decides when to REPORT; the write-off derives
  entirely from the renderer's cumulative received totals, never wall-clock,
  and a received-but-unparsed window is never written off). Heal = re-attach
  push listeners + pull restore markers through the modelRestoreNeeded router.
  E2e blackhole harness: `__terminalDeliveryWatchdog`,
  `terminal-push-delivery-loss-recovery.spec.ts`.
- **Producer flow control** (protocol v19 `pausePty`/`resumePty`, 256KB pause /
  32KB resume watermarks, keyed off **pendingData only** — never renderer
  counters; kill switch `PRODUCER_FLOW_CONTROL_ENABLED`, ipc/pty.ts): when main's
  buffer grows, the *shell* blocks. For main-hosted ptys pause is synchronous
  (drops impossible); for daemon ptys the pause notify has ~20-30ms socket
  latency, so wire-speed bursts can still cross the 2MB cap (known follow-up:
  daemon-side self-pacing watermark).

### 5. Flood resilience (why bulk output can't wedge or lie anymore)
- **Restore-loop cut** (pty-connection.ts): the hidden-output-restore loop
  abandons immediately when a foreground pane's live-chunk queue overflows
  (3-iteration hard cap), and a 2s flood-suppression window stops main's own
  backpressure drops (`droppedOutput`/`modelRestoreNeeded`) from re-arming
  restore — bytes write through, ONE deferred repaint heals after the flood.
  This killed a positive feedback loop (restore starves ACKs → main drops →
  drop re-arms restore) that caused multi-second renderer stalls.
- **Query survival**: if the 2MB cap ever drops bulk output, embedded terminal
  queries are extracted (`terminal-reply-query-extraction.ts`) and answered by
  *synthesizing replies on the input path* (CPR from live buffer, DA1 canned,
  OSC via direct responder) — probes and TUIs never hang on a dropped reply.
- Drops are downstream of the model: the daemon ingests every byte, so the
  post-flood repaint restores complete, correct content.

### 6. Wake/sleep recovery
- powerMonitor resume → `system:resumed` IPC → renderer wake recovery (fixes
  WebGL-latch blank-after-sleep that DOM focus/visibilitychange missed).
- Cumulative ACKs make the historical "lost ACKs across suspend pin the global
  window forever" wedge (BMW user bug) structurally impossible.

### 7. Snapshot fidelity (the garble fixes — all fuzz-pinned)
Reveal-from-snapshot multiplied exposure of serializer defects ~1000×. Five bugs
found by differential fuzzing; four fixed, one tolerated:
- **B: SGR intensity ordering** — upstream `@xterm/addon-serialize` emitted
  `1;22` (22 clears the bold 1 just set). Patched via pnpm patch
  (`config/patches/@xterm__addon-serialize@*.patch`): clear-before-set for the
  bold/dim group (+2 sibling bare-22 defects).
- **C: cursor off-by-one at wrap-pending margin** — bypassed entirely:
  `serializeWithAbsoluteCursor` (`terminal-serialize-absolute-cursor.ts`)
  appends absolute CUP from the source terminal's authoritative cursor
  (skipped when wrap-pending, where CUP would corrupt).
- **D: DECSC saved-cursor register not serialized** — snapshot appends
  `CUP(saved) + ESC 7 + CUP(actual)` when a register exists.
- **E: snapshot mid-escape-sequence** (fired on 24% of fuzz corpus) —
  `terminal-partial-escape-tail.ts` is a fold-safe VT-parser-state scanner; the
  unparsed tail ships as `TerminalSnapshot.pendingEscapeTailAnsi` and is written
  LAST on restore so continuation bytes complete the sequence. Seq accounting
  unchanged (the tail is a suffix of bytes ≤ snapshot seq).
- **A (tolerated)**: upstream wrap-null-cell serialize defect — fenced by
  `bufferHasSerializeHostileWrappedRow`, the only remaining tolerance.

## Correctness infrastructure (run these before merging delivery/restore changes)
- `headless-emulator-fidelity.fuzz.test.ts` — differential: HeadlessEmulator vs
  reference xterm, seeded TUI streams. `FUZZ_ITERATIONS=2000` for deep,
  `FUZZ_SEED=n` to replay.
- `hidden-reveal-reconciliation.fuzz.test.ts` — property tests: random
  hide/reveal boundaries × snapshot seq × racing chunks must equal an
  always-visible reference.
- `terminal-snapshot-serialize-roundtrip.test.ts` — the garble repros (unskipped
  = regression alarms).
- e2e: `terminal-hidden-view-parking` (incl. 25-cycle park/reveal drift test —
  byte-identical vs control), `terminal-parked-memory`,
  `terminal-sleep-wake-restore`.
- Scheduler credit-invariant + ack-gate deferred-credit + restore-flood tests
  (pane-manager / terminal-pane suites).

## Benchmarking protocol (hard-won rules)
- Rig: `tools/benchmarks/terminal-pipeline-bench.mjs` — DSR idle + DSR under
  1MB/s agent-TUI load + DSR-fenced throughput on 4 fixtures. Run *inside* the
  terminal under test.
- **Bench at 10MB** (`--size-mb 10`). The ACK-at-parse bug shipped because dev
  benches used 3MB and never tripped the cap.
- Load-controlled A/B only: alternate builds within one session; dev carries ~2×
  day-to-day variance. Never conclude from runs while agents/builds hammer the
  machine (two false convictions came from this).
- Never set `ORCA_E2E_USER_DATA_DIR` for benches (arms the e2e ACK gate → hang).
- Packaged builds are truth; dev has ~2× overhead.

## Release mechanics
- Perf RCs: `release-cut.yml` workflow_dispatch, `kind=rc ref=orca-performance
  version_suffix=perf` → tags like `v1.4.122-rc.1.perf`. The suffix sorts above
  its base rc.N but below rc.N+1 (never hijacks the RC channel). The rc counter
  (`release-rc-history.mjs`), telemetry identity classifier, and build guard are
  all suffix-aware — a suffixed rc classifies as `rc`.
- cmd/ctrl-click "Check for Updates" fetches the latest perf-tagged release
  (PR #7278; merged here) — perf-line users self-update after one manual install.

## Syncing with main: MERGE, never rebase

`orca-performance` is a long-lived, shared, continuously-pushed integration
branch — RCs are cut from it and agents branch off it. **Always
`git merge origin/main`; never rebase** (rebasing rewrites pushed history and
strands every RC tag, fix branch, and worktree based on the old commits).
Conflict pattern, established over ~6 syncs:

1. **Our structure wins; main's semantics graft in.** This branch deliberately
   restructures terminal code (shared scanners, single-policy handlers,
   model/view split). When main adds a feature inside code we've restructured,
   keep our shape and port their new behavior into it. Example: main inlined an
   OSC 133 parser to add `onCommandStarted` (133;C); we kept the shared
   `createOsc133CommandFinishedScanner` (main's side-effect tracker must parse
   byte-identically) and added 133;C support to the shared scanner instead.
2. Preserve the invariants in **Guardrails** below through every resolution —
   especially chunk-credit, `pendingData`-keyed flow control, and the
   single `handleCommandFinished` policy (byte path AND sideEffect-fact path
   route through it).
3. After resolving: `pnpm typecheck`, the terminal-pane + ipc/pty + daemon
   suites, and both fuzz suites. Commit the merge with a message stating what
   was kept from each side; push. If the push races a moved remote, merge the
   remote tip — never `pull --rebase` a merge.
4. If a sync lands anything on the delivery/restore path, re-run a 10MB bench
   before the next RC cut.

## Known limits / next levers (in rough priority order)
1. Daemon self-pacing: daemon-hosted ptys can cross the 2MB cap for ~20-30ms at
   wire speed before `pausePty` bites. Fix: daemon enforces its own watermark
   locally (VS Code does this server-side for remotes).
2. Cadence floor to the 4.5ms goal: xterm's 12ms parse slices and remaining
   drain cadence dominate the 13.3ms prod p50.
3. utilityProcess router endgame: take main off the per-byte hot path
   (VS Code's ptyHost→renderer MessagePort shape).
4. SerializeAddon full-buffer stalls at 50k-row scrollbacks (#5096 follow-up).
5. Peel PRs to main: throughput fixes → batch+MessageChannel → flow control →
   term-speed-2 last. PR #7214 is the integration overview; #7260 (wake/ACK)
   is open against main separately.

## Guardrails for future agents
- The chunk-credit invariant (§4) is the load-bearing one. If you add ANY path
  that receives, defers, drops, or splits pty data in the renderer, prove it
  credits exactly once. The credit-invariant unit tests are the gate.
- Flow control keys off `pendingData` only. Do not couple it to renderer
  counters; the two layers compose because they are independent.
- Snapshot changes must keep seq semantics: a snapshot covers *exactly* bytes
  ≤ its seq (Bug E made this true; don't regress it). Chunks after restore are
  reconciled by seq — off-by-N re-triggers duplicate-drop garble.
- Hidden panes must receive nothing (delivery gate) but side-effects and query
  replies must stay live via the model. If you add a new query type, wire it
  through model authority AND the drop-path synthesis.
- Never add timeout-based recovery that mutates counters (user requirement —
  design decision from #7260). Deterministic resync or nothing; hygiene timers
  may only log.
- Any change on the delivery/restore path: run both fuzz suites, the roundtrip
  tests, the chain e2e trio, AND a 10MB bench before calling it done.
